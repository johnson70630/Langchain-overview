      "Both universities are located in Los Angeles and are members of the Pac-12 Conference, and both will move together to the Big Ten Conference in 2024. The rivalry between the two is among the more unusual in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I sports, because the campuses are only 12 miles (19 km) apart, and both are located within the same megacity.\n",
      "UCLA teams have won the second-most NCAA Division I-sanctioned team championships, while USC has the third-most.  Only Stanford University, a fellow Pac-12 member also located in California, has more than either UCLA or USC.\n",

      "The Victory Bell is a 295-pound (134 kg) brass bell that originally rang atop a Southern Pacific railroad locomotive. It is currently mounted on a special wheeled carriage.\n",

      "Page: USC Trojans\n",
      "Summary: The USC Trojans (also Southern California Trojans) are the intercollegiate athletic teams that represent the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles. While the men's teams are nicknamed the Trojans, the women's athletic teams are referred to as either the Trojans or Women of Troy (the university officially approves both terms). The program participates in the Pac-12 Conference and has won 136 team national championships, 112 of which are National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) national championships. USC's official colors are cardinal and gold. The Trojans have a cross-town rivalry in several sports with UCLA. However, USC's football rivalry with Notre Dame predates the UCLA rivalry by three years. The Notre Dame rivalry stems mainly from the annual football game played between these two universities and is considered the greatest intersectional rivalry in college football.   The Trojans also enjoy a rivalry with the Stanford Cardinal.   The USC Trojans are considered one of the most successful college athletic programs of all time.\n",
      "USC will soon join the Big Ten (B1G) Conference along with UCLA, Washington, and Oregon in 2024.\n",

      "Final Answer: The rivalry between USC and UCLA is an American collegiate athletics rivalry between the UCLA Bruins and USC Trojans, with both universities located in Los Angeles and being members of the Pac-12 Conference. The rivalry is unique due to the close proximity of the campuses and the success of both schools in NCAA Division I sports.\u001b[0m\n",
